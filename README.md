This is an experiment using Electron and Bulma CSS to make a file transfer desktop app which will hopefully be cross-platform. 
I am attempting to use a js script with portforwarding to transfer files between various devices. 
This is a client to make the user experience more easy, as running the scripts by hand is tedious and impractical.
Hopefully it works out!
